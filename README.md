# Glass of coke rendering

## Overall ([report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y48_KAl0-PUQekoeWXARbjMI1Tb5IlF1/view?usp=share_link))
The objective of this project is to render a glass containing Coca-Cola using rib primitives and apply suitable BRDF models to accurately represent the objectâ€™s appearance. Additionally, the project involves implementing texture and displacement patterns on the table beneath the main object. Furthermore, an environment map was incorporated to provide realistic lighting. Finally, motion blur and depth of field techniques were employed to enhance the overall visual quality of the rendering.
